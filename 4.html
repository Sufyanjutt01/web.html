<h1>1. Is A Small Business Venture In The Cards?</h1>
<pe>If the idea of buying a small business has crossed your mind, are you at the point now where you want to make that a reality?

Buying a small business is a big step no matter how you look at it.<br>
That said it could turn out to be one of the biggest and best moves you make in your business life.

With that in mind; how best to go about making this happen?
<h3>What to Look for in a Business?</h3>
<pe>Given you do not want to make a bad mistake in acquiring your small business; here are a few things to run through:
<h4>Your financial setup </h4>
<pe> Obviously you do not want to go into buying a small business if money is going to be an issue. Sit down ahead of time and go over your financial outlook. Are you in good position when it comes to money? Is there anything worrying you when it comes to debt, tax issues and more? While you may owe a little money to one or more businesses, people and so on, you don’t want to be in the hole for a lot.
<h4>Acquiring that business</h4>
<pe>Will you do all the heavy lifting when it comes to acquiring or will you have some help? Turning to a startup acquisition marketplace is often a good idea. Doing this allows you to have important information at your fingertips. From the financial well-being of a business you look to buy to other data that is key to the decision, don’t go into it alone. Having pros helping you makes for a better chance you come away with the right business at the right time.
<h4>Will employees be necessary?</h4>
<pe>Unless you are going to be the only employee with your new small business, odds are you will need help. So, take the time to carefully hire the right people for the right positions. In buying a business, there is of course the possibility you will inherit employees that come with it. This of course is something you and the seller should discuss. It would not be fair to leave employees hanging. Letting them know if you want them or you will hire your own team is important.
