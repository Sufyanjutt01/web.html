<h1>2.How Athletes Can Achieve Self-Discipline?</h1>

In order to build and strengthen our sports performance, we should have a continual process. Athletes must be trustworthy, ethical and competent. Discipline requires a code of conduct, which shapes our behaviors. The code will allow us to develop a degree or self-discipline and authority, regardless of the highly competitive conditions.

There could be harsh penalty related to any kind of violation, depending on the team. In some cases, players may not be allowed to participate in a number of important games. Coaches should be able to wisely exercise their discretionary power, so they are able to make sure that punishment can have positive results. Athletes shouldn’t directly denigrate or display total disrespect towards others. Any kind of physical confrontation should be deliberately avoided.

This should allow us to develop our own character, especially if we can identify our own weaknesses and strengths, Eventually, self-discipline will emerge and we will be able to control our own impulsive nature. Things that need to be improved can be handled more appropriately. Professional athletes are known for their humility, with a complete understanding that they are not perfect. By constantly improving themselves, they will have the indomitable spirit to motivate themselves against overwhelming odds. Mastery of positive tenets can’t be easily achieved by normal persons.

Athletes should be properly dressed and they need to be ready for any kind of training session.

If they arrive late, there should be a kind of punishment that can be delivered, without damaging their motivation. It is important for athletes to remain attentive to things that are being taught. Improper preparation could cause injuries and if it happens, there should be a small team that can provide immediate assistance. Training etiquette shouldn’t be allowed to lapse or the training session will start to deteriorate.
